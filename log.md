# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 17, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the basic HTML exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started learning to code HTML, CSS, and JS. I have minimal experience coding in C++ and Java and wanted to give Front End Development a try. So far, it is very interesting.
