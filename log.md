# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 17, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the basic HTML exercises on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started learning to code HTML, CSS, and JS. I have minimal experience coding in C++ and Java and wanted to give Front End Development a try. So far, it is very interesting.

### Day 2: July 18, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed the Introduction to basic CSS exercises on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts** I am more committed and determined than before. Learning the basics to HTML and CSS has been a breeze due to prior educational experience with C++ and Java. Cannot wait to feel confident enough to make my first project as I already have a few ideas.
